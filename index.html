  <h3>Bio</h3>

  <p>I am an internationally published PhD candidate, with my thesis submitted for external examination in November 2020, my expected graduation date is April 2021. Through the course of completing my postgraduate studies, I have honed my critical
    thinking and independent learning skills and pride myself on being a quick learner of novel topics. I enjoy working with others and collaborating on complex problems, as I am a firm believer that nothing of great value can be achieved through
    solitary efforts.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am looking to diversify my skill set to a more software focused career. I am interested in data analytics, machine learning, and full stack web development.
